script finding should go from zsh/nu or pwsh/zu, ie both should see eaech other

typing --help (or -h) on the flags should be detected, like wut p l -g --help

typing -h at all levels should work

wut p f -g should print all the group ones.. and should respect partial match filters

wut f should not prompt for y/n
